# DevSecOps Pipeline for Infinite Mario

In today‚Äôs fast-paced software development environment, security, speed, and reliability are critical. This project demonstrates the creation of a **secure and automated DevSecOps pipeline** for the Infinite Mario JavaScript game, seamlessly integrating development, security, and deployment processes in a cloud-native setup.

---

üöÄ **Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to establish a robust DevSecOps pipeline automating code quality checks, security scans, and deployment for the Infinite Mario JavaScript game. By leveraging modern tools and cloud infrastructure, the pipeline enhances the development lifecycle with built-in security and scalability.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

1. **Code Quality and Security**
   - **SonarQube:** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify code smells, bugs, and vulnerabilities.

2. **Container Security**
   - **Grype:** Vulnerability scanning for container images to ensure production-ready containers.

3. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**
   - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Scalable cloud-native deployments.
   - **Terraform:** Infrastructure provisioning and management as code.

4. **CI/CD Automation**
   - **GitHub Actions:** Automated CI/CD workflows for build, test, security checks, and deployment.

---

üìã **Key Features and Workflow**

1. **Code Quality Checks**
   - Code pushed to GitHub triggers **SonarQube** scans for vulnerabilities.
   - Issues flagged are resolved before proceeding.

2. **Container Security**
   - **Docker** containers are built and scanned using **Grype** for vulnerabilities.
   - Vulnerable builds are halted until fixed.

3. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   - **Terraform** provisions resources in AKS.
   - Security best practices like **RBAC** and network policies are implemented.

4. **Automated CI/CD Workflows**
   - **Build and Test:** Code compilation, unit testing, and packaging.
   - **Security Scans:** Mandatory SonarQube and Grype checks.
   - **Deployment:** Verified builds are deployed to AKS via Helm charts.

---

üîí **Security First Approach**

- **Shift Left Security:** Tools like SonarQube and Grype detect vulnerabilities early.
- **Container Hardening:** Secure images reduce risks in production.
- **RBAC & Least Privilege:** AKS is configured for role-based access control.

---

üåê **Results and Impact**

1. Early vulnerability detection reduced costs and risks.
2. Automation enhanced deployment reliability and minimized human error.
3. Scalable infrastructure via AKS ensures resilience and adaptability.

---

üìñ **Lessons Learned**

1. Security can enhance agility when integrated early.
2. Automation frees developers for innovation.
3. Cloud-native solutions simplify scalability and management.

---

üõ†Ô∏è **What‚Äôs Next?**

1. Add Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).
2. Integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring.
3. Explore multi-cloud deployments for enhanced redundancy.

‚ú® **Final Thoughts**

This project highlights the power of **DevSecOps** in bridging the gap between development, operations, and security. By integrating tools like SonarQube, Grype, and GitHub Actions with cloud infrastructure such as AKS, secure and scalable pipelines can deliver quality software faster than ever.
