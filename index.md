 ## Projects
 - # Welcome to My DevSecOps Projects

## Building a Scalable and Secure DevSecOps Pipeline for Infinite Mario Game

This project showcases a secure, automated DevSecOps pipeline for the Infinite Mario JavaScript game, emphasizing code quality, security, and seamless deployment. It integrates SonarQube for SAST, Grype for container security, and IaC with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Using GitHub Actions, the CI/CD workflow ensures rapid, secure, and reliable releases, demonstrating a robust DevSecOps lifecycle for cloud-based applications.
